New York City study spots

# Criteria
* In New York City
* Indoors
* You can read a book and/or go on your laptop there for an extended period of time
    * So most restaurants are disqualified
* Reasonably good lighting
* Has a bathroom
* Open after 6 pm on (most) weekdays
    * There are tons of coffee shops in New York City that are good places to study during the day. They're not too hard to find.
        * That being said, I highly recommend Remi43 Flower and Coffee on 43rd St and 2nd Ave in Midtown East
     
# The spots
Once I figure out how to embed Google Maps links and/or photos, this site will be much nicer.

## Manhattan

### Coffee shops
* The Bean
    * Three locations, all in Greenwich Village/East Village
    * Open until 9 pm
    * Coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, pastries, bagels, quiches, açai bowls and bowls of that sort
    * Bathroom is decent, they hand you a key on a long stick which is a fun touch
    * Wifi is a bit spotty
    * A few power outlets
    * They had an open mic like one time I went but I have not encountered it since then
  * Pause Cafe
      * LES
      * Food is great
      * Decor is really beautiful
      * I don't know what the evening vibe is – people were studying there on a weekend afternoon but it's possible it gets more restaurant-y in the evening
  * Black Cat LES
      * Pretty dark
      * Has a comedy open mic on Monday (?) nights 
  * Caffé Bene
      * Doesn't "feel" like a study spot but I can't put my finger on why exactly. It gives more like takeout vibes for some reason
      * Has a bathroom, have not tried it
      * Wifi is good
      * Has outlets
      * Closes at 8 pm on weekdays (although the sign on the door says 10)
   
### Libraries
TODO

### POPS (privately owned public spaces)

## Brooklyn
* Qahwah House
    * Williamsburg (also they opened a location in the West Village I believe but I cannot vouch for it)
    * Open late (like 11am on weekdays and 1am on Friday and Saturday nights)
    * Friday and Saturday nights it's a bit more of a social hub - it's still brightly lit but if you stick around with a book or laptop you might be kind of annoying
    * Their spiced coffees and teas are delicious. Consider ordering to-go even if you're staying because the option to stay is a pot with multiple drinks
    * They also have delicious pastries and ginger turmeric milk if you don't want caffeine. But again, go for the to-go cup unless you want multiple cups of hot milk
* Lincoln Station
    * Prospect Heights (?)
    * The sandwiches are good
    * Not too many outlets
    * They have a thing of 

## Queens
* Paris Baguette, Long Island City
    * There are a few other Paris Baguettes but I don't know about their seating situations
    * Pastries are good and food is decent, not too many options that aren't super buttery though
    * Wifi is bad and cell reception is also bad 

## The Bronx and Staten Island
I'm a yuppie. I don't spend much time there.
