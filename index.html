      <h1 id="nycstudyspots">nycstudyspots</h1>
<p>New York City study spots</p>

<h1 id="criteria">Criteria</h1>
<ul>
  <li>In New York City</li>
  <li>Indoors</li>
  <li>You can read a book and/or go on your laptop there for an extended period of time
    <ul>
      <li>So most restaurants are disqualified</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reasonably good lighting</li>
  <li>Has a bathroom</li>
  <li>Open after 6 pm on (most) weekdays
    <ul>
      <li>There are tons of coffee shops in New York City that are good places to study during the day. They’re not too hard to find.
        <ul>
          <li>That being said, I highly recommend Remi43 Flower and Coffee on 43rd St and 2nd Ave in Midtown East</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-spots">The spots</h1>
<p>Once I figure out how to embed Google Maps links and/or photos, this site will be much nicer.</p>

<h2 id="manhattan">Manhattan</h2>

<h3 id="coffee-shops">Coffee shops</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Bean
    <ul>
      <li>Three locations, all in Greenwich Village/East Village</li>
      <li>Open until 9 pm</li>
      <li>Coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, pastries, bagels, quiches, açai bowls and bowls of that sort</li>
      <li>They hand you the bathroom key on a long stick which is a fun touch</li>
      <li>Wifi is a bit spotty</li>
      <li>A few power outlets</li>
      <li>They had an open mic like one time I went but I have not encountered it since then</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pause Cafe
    <ul>
      <li>LES</li>
      <li>Food is great</li>
      <li>Decor is really beautiful</li>
      <li>I don’t know what the evening vibe is – people were studying there on a weekend afternoon but it’s possible it gets more restaurant-y in the evening</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Boris and Horton
    <ul>
      <li>East Village</li>
      <li>Dogs!!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Roost
    <ul>
      <li>Pretty dark</li>
      <li>Speakeasy
        <ul>
          <li>It is a bar, but they have separate, connected rooms for the bar part and the not-bar part; the not-bar part allows laptops and the bar part doesn’t. It’s pretty quiet on weekday evenings</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>They have open mics sometimes and sometimes have people singing and playing guitar in a way that feels open mic-ish but is apparently scheduled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Black Cat LES
    <ul>
      <li>Pretty dark</li>
      <li>Has a comedy open mic on Monday (?) nights</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Caffé Bene
    <ul>
      <li>Doesn’t “feel” like a study spot but I can’t put my finger on why exactly. It gives more like takeout vibes for some reason</li>
      <li>Has a bathroom, have not tried it</li>
      <li>Wifi is good</li>
      <li>Has outlets</li>
      <li>Closes at 8 pm on weekdays (although the sign on the door says 10)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Greats of Craft
    <ul>
      <li>Sort of a bar but they have this room that people seem to ready/work at even in the evenings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>Pretty much any library is a good study spot, but most are closed in the evenings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library
    <ul>
      <li>Midtown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pops-privately-owned-public-spaces">POPS (privately owned public spaces)</h3>
<p>There are many of these (largely in Midtown ish) – there’s a directory at https://apops.mas.org/. However, most are not indoors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>575 5th Ave</li>
  <li>120 Park Avenue</li>
  <li>590 Madison Avenue
    <ul>
      <li>Very airy and plant-filled</li>
      <li>Langroops, a language exchange group, meets here sometimes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Hugh
    <ul>
      <li>Food court in Midtown East</li>
      <li>Various kinds of meetups seem to happen here (I’ve seen alumni groups and board game groups)</li>
      <li>If Teranga is open, you have to try it – it’s a West African fast-casual stall and one of my favorite food places in the city</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="brooklyn">Brooklyn</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Qahwah House
    <ul>
      <li>Williamsburg (also they opened a location in the West Village I believe but I cannot vouch for it)</li>
      <li>Open late (like 11am on weekdays and 1am on Friday and Saturday nights)</li>
      <li>Friday and Saturday nights it’s a bit more of a social hub - it’s still brightly lit but if you stick around with a book or laptop you might be kind of annoying</li>
      <li>Their spiced coffees and teas are delicious. Consider ordering to-go even if you’re staying because the option to stay is a pot with multiple drinks</li>
      <li>They also have delicious pastries and ginger turmeric milk if you don’t want caffeine. But again, go for the to-go cup unless you want multiple cups of hot milk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nook
    <ul>
      <li>Bushwick</li>
      <li>Has a cute reading nook (hence the name I assume)
        <ul>
          <li>But it’s a bit awkward to sit in for too long</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>They have events in the evenings but I haven’t tried them out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lincoln Station
    <ul>
      <li>Prospect Heights (?)</li>
      <li>They have a broccoli sandwich which is interesting but honestly not that great</li>
      <li>Not too many outlets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="queens">Queens</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Paris Baguette, Long Island City
    <ul>
      <li>There are a few other Paris Baguettes but I don’t know about their seating situations</li>
      <li>Pastries are good and food is decent, not too many options that aren’t super buttery though</li>
      <li>Wifi is bad and cell reception is also bad</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bronx-and-staten-island">The Bronx and Staten Island</h2>
<p>I’m a yuppie. I don’t spend much time there.</p>
