New York City study spots

by Sourabh Chakraborty

Last updated: May 2024

# Criteria
* In New York City
* Indoors
* You can read a book and/or go on your laptop there for an extended period of time
    * So most restaurants are disqualified
* Reasonably good lighting
* Has a bathroom
* Open after 6 pm on (most) weekdays
    * There are tons of coffee shops in New York City that are good places to study during the day. They're not too hard to find.
        * That being said, I highly recommend Remi43 Flower and Coffee on 43rd St and 2nd Ave in Midtown East
     
# The spots
Once I figure out how to embed Google Maps links and/or photos, this site will be much nicer.

## Manhattan

### Coffee shops
* The Bean
    * Three locations, all in Greenwich Village/East Village
    * Open until 9 pm
    * Coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, pastries, bagels, quiches, açai bowls and bowls of that sort
    * They hand you the bathroom key on a long stick which is a fun touch
    * Wifi is a bit spotty
    * A few power outlets
    * They had an open mic like one time I went but I have not encountered it since then
* Pause Cafe
    * LES
    * Food is great
    * Decor is really beautiful
    * I don't know what the evening vibe is – people were studying there on a weekend afternoon but it's possible it gets more restaurant-y in the evening
* Boris and Horton
    * East Village
    * Dogs!!
* The Roost
    * Pretty dark
    * Speakeasy
        * It is a bar, but they have separate, connected rooms for the bar part and the not-bar part; the not-bar part allows laptops and the bar part doesn't. It's pretty quiet on weekday evenings
    * They have open mics sometimes and sometimes have people singing and playing guitar in a way that feels open mic-ish but is apparently scheduled
* Black Cat LES
    * Pretty dark
    * Has a comedy open mic on Monday (?) nights 
* Caffé Bene
    * Doesn't "feel" like a study spot but I can't put my finger on why exactly. It gives more like takeout vibes for some reason
    * Has a bathroom, have not tried it
    * Wifi is good
    * Has outlets
    * Closes at 8 pm on weekdays (although the sign on the door says 10)
* The Greats of Craft
    * Sort of a bar but they have this room that people seem to read/work at even in the evenings
   
### Libraries
Pretty much any library is a good study spot, but most are closed in the evenings.

* Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library
    * Midtown

### POPS (privately owned public spaces)
There are many of these (largely in Midtown ish) – there's a directory at https://apops.mas.org/. However, most are not indoors. 
* 575 5th Ave
* 120 Park Avenue
* 590 Madison Avenue
    * Very airy and plant-filled
    * Langroops, a language exchange group, meets here sometimes
 
### Other
* The Hugh
    * Food court in Midtown East
    * Various kinds of meetups seem to happen here (I've seen alumni groups and board game groups)
    * If Teranga is open, you have to try it – it's a West African fast-casual stall and one of my favorite food places in the city

## Brooklyn
* Qahwah House
    * Williamsburg (also they opened a location in the West Village I believe but I cannot vouch for it)
    * Open late (like 11am on weekdays and 1am on Friday and Saturday nights)
    * Friday and Saturday nights it's a bit more of a social hub - it's still brightly lit but if you stick around with a book or laptop you might be kind of annoying
    * Their spiced coffees and teas are delicious. Consider ordering to-go even if you're staying because the option to stay is a pot with multiple drinks
    * They also have delicious pastries and ginger turmeric milk if you don't want caffeine. But again, go for the to-go cup unless you want multiple cups of hot milk
* Nook
    * Bushwick
    * Has a cute reading nook (hence the name I assume)
        * But it's a bit awkward to sit in for too long
    * They have events in the evenings but I haven't tried them out 
* Lincoln Station
    * Prospect Heights (?)
    * They have a broccoli sandwich which is interesting but honestly not that great
    * Not too many outlets

## Queens
* Paris Baguette, Long Island City
    * There are a few other Paris Baguettes but I don't know about their seating situations
    * Pastries are good and food is decent, not too many options that aren't super buttery though
    * Wifi is bad and cell reception is also bad 

## The Bronx and Staten Island
I'm a yuppie. I don't spend much time there.
